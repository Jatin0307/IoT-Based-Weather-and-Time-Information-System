# IoT-Based-Weather-and-Time-Information-System
This project is a smart mirror system designed to deliver real-time information using an ESP32 microcontroller and a 1.8" TFT display. The main objective of the system is to provide continuous updates on the current time, date, weather conditions, and calendar events by integrating various web APIs.
The display is positioned behind a two-way mirror, allowing the user to view live data without obstructing their reflection. By connecting to the internet via Wi-Fi, the ESP32 fetches data from NTP servers for accurate time synchronization and uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather information. The calendar section displays scheduled events or reminders, offering an at-a-glance overview of the day.
This IoT-based solution is a compact, efficient, and visually integrated information system that combines smart technology with daily utility. It demonstrates the application of embedded systems, cloud APIs, and real-time data processing in a functional and user-centric way.
